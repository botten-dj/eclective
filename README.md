# eclective
The Eclectic Collective sonic mix challenge. Do one remix of a track randomly picked from your eclectic music collection.

## How to take part

Set yourself a music mix challenge each week and share your results here. If you're a friend of mine, your music collection is probably way eclectic. I'm talking super-eclectic. Superclectic.

- Select a track at random. (Here's a [script](pick-file.bat) I use on Windows file systems)
- Make a remix of the track using your favorite Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) - really make it your own!
- Commit your results and raw files here

As we progress we will have special events and challenges.

Have fun and B ECLECTIC!!
